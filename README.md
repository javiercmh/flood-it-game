# flood-it-game

A fun game I made using Processing. You start with a random colorful board and your goal is to end up with a 1-color board. Give it a try!

# Requirements

Processing 3 will work although it was made with Processing 2.

# Installation

You have 2 possibilities:
 
1. Download PC or Linux versions I made
2. Clone repository and run from source code

# Screenshots

That's me playing
